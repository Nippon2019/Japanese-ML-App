# Japanese-ML-App
Create an App that recognizes handwritten Japanese characters, including Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.

## Discription
User can handwrite in either Hiragana, Katakana, or Kanji, and the app will recognize the handwriting and give its top 3 choices as the answer. User can click on the correct character to enter the text at the bottom of the screen. User can click on the swtich mode button to switch between the 3 types of characters (Hiragana, Katakana, or Kanji). User can click on the copy text button to copy text to device.

## Notes
To see how to create the three mlmodels (`hiragana.mlmodel`,`katakana.mlmodel`,`kanji.mlmodel`), checkout the github page [Handwritten Japanese Recognition](https://github.com/Nippon2019/Handwritten-Japanese-Recognition)
